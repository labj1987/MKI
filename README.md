# Mainline Kernel Installer (MKI)

GTK4 + libadwaita desktop app for installing Ubuntu mainline kernels from
kernel.ubuntu.com, written in Rust. Distributed as an AppImage.

## Why this exists

Mainline kernel tools have a habit of installing a kernel without
generating its initramfs, because they parse the kernel version out of a
filename and the mainline naming convention (7.1.3-070103-generic vs
7.1.3-generic) breaks the parse. The result is a kernel that VFS-panics
on boot. This app is built around not letting that happen:

- The kernel version is read from the .deb package metadata, never from
  filenames, and cross-checked against the /lib/modules directory that
  actually appears after install.
- The initramfs is generated and then VERIFIED to exist in /boot before
  the install reports success. A missing initrd fails the install loudly.
- The System tab health-checks every installed kernel for a missing
  initrd or modules directory, so a broken kernel is visible before a
  reboot instead of after.

## Features

- Browse stable mainline versions with newer/same/older badges relative
  to the running kernel
- SHA256 verification against the published CHECKSUMS file
- Per-file download progress with retries and cancellation
- Remove old kernels (running kernel is never removable)
- Disk space checks for /boot and /
- Install log in-app plus /var/log/mainline-kernel-installer.log

## Install

Download the AppImage from the Releases page:

```
chmod +x mainline-kernel-installer-*-x86_64.AppImage
./mainline-kernel-installer-*-x86_64.AppImage
```

First launch asks for authentication once to install the privileged
helper script and polkit policy to system paths.

## Using it

1. The System tab shows the running kernel and the health of every
   installed kernel.
2. Pick a version on the Browse tab and hit Download. Packages land in
   ~/Downloads/mainline-kernel-vX.Y.Z/ and are checksum-verified.
3. Review the staged packages on the Install tab and hit Install Kernel.
4. Reboot when ready. The new kernel only reports success after its
   initramfs is verified on disk.

## Notes

Developed and tested on Ubuntu 26.04, GNOME on Wayland. Mainline kernels
are unsigned: with Secure Boot enabled they will not boot without a
signing setup. Release candidates and daily builds are intentionally not
listed.

## Building from source

```
apt install -y cargo rustc libgtk-4-dev libadwaita-1-dev pkg-config libssl-dev
cargo build --release
```

Or build the AppImage the same way CI does:

```
bash build-appimage.sh
```
